## Installation
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `bundle install` in the repository.
3. Run `jekyll build`.
4. Configure your webserver to serve from `/{repo-dir}/_site/`

## How it works
This is a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) site. It uses [Rouge](https://github.com/jneen/rouge) for syntax highlighting,
but otherwise uses standard markdown provided by [Kramdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/).

## Hacking
To make changes to the site, navigate to the root of the repository and execut `jekyll build --watch`. This will
spawn a Jekyll process that monitors the file system for changes.

CSS is generated by parsing the [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) files in the `css` and `_sass` directories. Note that
partials are stored in the _sass directory.

The left hand menu content is controlled by `_data/docs.yml` and generated by `_includes/docs_ul.html`. To create
a new page, add a markdown file under `docs`. The frontmatter should look like this:

```yaml
---
layout: default
title: Quick-start guide
url: /docs/bootstrapping/
---
```

1. The `layout` will always be default.
2. The `title` should equal the title you would like to use in the `<title>` element and in the menu.
3. The `url` is what connects this markdown file to the menu item. It is matched based on menu item name, prepended with
`/docs/` and appended with `/`.
