## Getting Started

Install the PriceWaiter module by visiting the [Prestashop Addons Marketplace](http://addons.prestashop.com/en/pricing-promotion-prestashop-modules/19590-pricewaiter.html) or by searching for PriceWaiter in your back office's Modules & Themes Catalog. Once you've uploaded the .zip file you got from the Marketplace, finish the installation by clicking Install on the PriceWaiter listing under Pricing and Promotion.

## Creating your PriceWaiter account

If you already have a PriceWaiter account, you can skip this step and go straight to Your PriceWaiter API Key.

Once you've installed the PriceWaiter module, visit the module's configuration page by clicking Configure in the modules listing.

Here you'll find a link to sign up for a new PriceWaiter account.

Click the button and it will take you to PriceWaiter, where all your store's information will be pre-filled for you. Once you complete the sign-up process, there's just one more simple step to connect PriceWaiter to your store.

## Your PriceWaiter API Key

In your PriceWaiter account, find the Store Settings page (if you just signed up, it's the page you landed on. Otherwise, find it under STORE(S)->Your Store->Store Settings). At the top of this page is a big blue field containing your PriceWaiter API key.

Copy this key into the API Key field on PriceWaiter's configuration page in your back office, save the configurations, and you're ready to go!

## Positioning the PriceWaiter button

The PriceWaiter button is displayed as part of the Product Buttons section of each product page. You can change the order in which these buttons are displayed, effectively moving the PriceWaiter button around relative to the Add to Cart button and any social sharing, wishlist, or other buttons you may have configured, by going to the Module Positions screen in your back office,found in the menu under Modules->Positions.

You'll find the PriceWaiter module's hook here under the displayProductButtons heading.

We recommend placing the PriceWaiter button as close as possible to the Add to Cart button for maximum visibility and optimal results.

## Make PriceWaiter work for you!

Once you've copied your API key back to your PrestaShop account, you'll see a new link on the PriceWaiter module configuration page.
