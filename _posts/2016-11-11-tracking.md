When an order is placed on PriceWaiter you will want to capture that conversion event
in your analytics and tracking services. We provide two methods to accomplish this:

### [Conversion Pixel Settings](/conversion/pixels.html)

**Option 1:** The easiest and most reliable method is enter your [conversion pixel](/conversion/pixels.html) settings into your PriceWaiter account and we will fire the events at the right time.

### [Checkout Redirect](/conversion/checkout-redirect.html)

**Option 2:** After a successful checkout, we will redirect the buyer to a page on your website. Your technical team can configure all the conversion tracking code manually. Ready more about [conversion pixel](/conversion/checkout-redirect.html) settings.
