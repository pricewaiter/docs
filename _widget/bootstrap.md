The Name Your Price button requires 3 things on your page.

1. A `<span>` indicating where in the page to put the button
2. A `<script>` tag containing a variable called <strong>PriceWaiterOptions</strong> that sets the initial PriceWaiter config
3. A `<script>` tag that loads the Name Your Price widget.
