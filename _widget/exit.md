Exit Intent Offers allow you to target comparison shoppers as they attempt to leave your website.

Some of the features include:

- A/B testing: display evenly
- optimize for clicks
- Archive campaigns
- Campaign Date Range
- Variable Display sensitivity

Variable display sensitvity has 4 levels shown in the table below. The options range from conservative to aggressive.

| property | level 1 | level 2 | level 3 | level 4 |
|-------------|----------|----------|-----------|----------|
| max views | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
| time on page | 30 sec | 15 sec | 5 sec | 2 sec | 
| returning visitor | false | false | true | true |

If you want to temporarily disable Exit Intent Offers you can pass the variable pw_disable_conversion_tools = 1 and it will disable exit intent for 24 hours. Passing pw_disable_conversion_tools will create a cookie on the users web browser so they don't see exit intent again.
